**Make notes online, collaborate with friends easily!**

Today all of us are stuck at our homes dues to the CoronaVirus epidemic and students are stuck too when it comes to attending school and studying. So we thought why not use this opportunity to make an app that can help students and professinals to make notes online and collaborate over the internet to seemlesly work or study in this time.

# The Inspiration
I was inspired to make this app when me and a group of freinds wanted to study and make notes together but we were not able to meet at one place due to the COVID - 19 Virus, so i thought of connecting the internet to notes making so we can easily study and make notes together.

# The App
![Home page](https://i.ibb.co/n3zJC9K/2.png)
So this app basically leverages the power of realtime databases to collaborate for making notes, the app works like this:
 1. Click on the "Start a Session"
> This will start a new session and redirect you to a new page.
 2. Now start editing the new document.
 3. To collaborate, just copy the tab address and share it with your freinds to collaborate.
 4. If you want to edit these documents later, just save the link, these documents are saved online.

# Technical Part
 **Technologies use:**
This app is mainly programmed in **Javascript** as I am used to this language. I have used **Firebase** for the real time database.
Other tech used:

 - HTML
 - CSS

 **Libraries used:**
 - Firepad (firepad.io)
 
 **Tools Used**
 - Firebase

 # Building Process
The build was easier than I thought and it took me almost 4-5 hours to complete all of this. I used VSCode as my primary editor.

**Problem Encountered**
The main problem was with the Firepad library as it does not have a very rich documentation but I solved this problem by searching online and using tech articles. 
The UI was also a problem as I am not a very artistic person. :(

**What I learnt?**
I used Firebase for the first time and i absolutely loved it, I also learned a lot about collaboration and UI.
